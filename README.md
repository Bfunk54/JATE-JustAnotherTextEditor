## Tests
#
To install, clone the repo into your favorite code editor. Open the root folder in your terminal and run the command 'npm i' to install the needed dependencies to run this server. Now you should be able to run the command 'npm run start:dev' and it will build all the dependencies and bundles and the client and server should both start up.
To test, navigate to 'localhost:3000' in your favorite browser and you should be able to test all functionalities from there locally! Happy testing!
